# basic simulation parameters for AxiSEM3D
# NOTE:
# a) angles are measured in degrees and distances in kilometers
# b) string-typed parameters (except file names) are case insensitive
# c) bool-typed parameters can be specified by 1/0, true/false, yes/no and on/off
# d) the prefix of input files is path_of_executable/input/, similar for output

# list of volumetric 3D models
# Only the first MODEL_VOLUMETRIC_3D_NUM models will be used.
# A volumetric model may fall into one of the following four types: 
#   Absolute:       absolute vs, vp and rho values 
#   Reference1D:    perturbations w.r.t. the 1D reference model (MODEL_EXODUS_MESH_FILE)
#   Reference3D:    perturbations w.r.t. the current 3D model
#   ReferenceDiff:  perturbations w.r.t. the current 3D perturbations
# Absolute and Reference1D models overwrites the previous models if they overlap in space,
# while Reference3D and ReferenceDiff are based on the previous models. 
# Therefore, the order of this list DOES matter.

# ellipticity mode [off / geographic / full]
# off:        no ellipticity at all
# geographic: ellipticity is considered only in coordinate transformations
#             between geographic (lat, lon, depth) and geocentric (r, theta, phi),
#             e.g., wehen locating the source and receviers  
# full:       beside geographic, the mesh will be "stretched" (expensive)

# ocean load [none / constant / 3d_model]
# none:     no ocean
# constant: constant ocean depth. The PREM value (3 km) is used by default.
#           Specify any other constant values by constant$value
# 3d_model: specify a 3d ocean model, such as "crust1"
# In AxiSEM3D, we model ocean by means of additional surface mass, which becomes  
# inaccurate at very short periods, typically below roughly 5s, as tested by 
# Komatitsch and Tromp, Geophys. J. Int. (2002) 150 (1): 303-318.
